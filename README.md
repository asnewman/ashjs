# ashjs

I am building the best frontend JavaScript framework. It is so good that I've named it after myself!

## Principles

- Encourage vanilla JavaScript, there are no escape hatches because you are not trapped
- Allow for frontend data structures to be passed from the backend
- Support just enough to build simple UIs. If you can't build it with ash.js, it's your designer/PM's fault.
- The framework is one file, no dependencies

## Short term goals

- Built in routing
- Enable JavaScript function to be sent from the backend
- Enable backend function calls from the frontend
- Build a small project with ash.js to prove its viability
- Build out documentation
